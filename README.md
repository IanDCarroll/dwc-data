This README outlines a potential data project for the Downtown Women's Center.

## Notes from 10/25/2016

__Goal:__ Empower Women

__How:__ Make an interface + database

### Key Players

* Chief Program Manager - needs Service Counter metrics.
* Day Center Manager - needs statistics.
* Client - homeless or low income women who need services.

Sample Client interactions - "Annabelle" enters the Day Center and has the option of:

1. Receiving (searching?) for services in the Health Center.
2. Receiving meals, showers, etc. from the Service Counter.
3. Going to a Case Manager for triage to receive housing/shelter.

### Features

#### 1 (Need)

[Input] As Day Center Manager, I need an easy form to input who is using our facility so I can plan.

Data needed for New clients:

* Name
* Demographics
* Requirements
* Services Used

#### 2 (Need)

[Output] As the Chief Program Manager, I need good Service Counter metrics so I can tailor our services to give our participants what they need to succeed.

#### 3 (Need)

[Input] As a Service Provider, I need an easy way to track who is using the service so I can plan.

Data needed for the Service Counter:

Example: a participant search.

### Additional Notes

1. How does the user interact with the form?
2. Test whether interface makes sense.
